    <h2>1. Who Am I?.</h2>
    <div class="container">
    <img src="Who-Am-I-Fun-Family-Games-600x400.png" alt=""></div>
    <h3>This is a game that everyone has probably played at least once at a party, and it’s also a quick and easy,<br> last-minute, family game. To begin, each person gets 20 questions to find out “who they are.” For example,<br> we like to use Disney characters and cartoons when we play with our little kids.  Sometimes <br> we’ll even use the names of our extended family!</h3>
    
    <h2>2.The Name Game.</h2>
    <div class="img">
    <img src="The-Name-Game-Fun-Family-Games.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <h3>In this game, everyone comes up with the name of a person (for example, it can be someone you know, a celebrity, etc.) <br> but don’t tell anyone–write it down! After that, you’ll write the names on slips of paper which are then drawn. <br> Clues are given, and everyone tries to guess who that person is! <br> So fun, right?! This game is a great way to practice your acting skills</h3>


    <h2>3.Take a Hint.</h2>
    <div class="img">
    <img src="Take-a-Hint-Fun-Family-Games-600x400.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <h3>You’ll need 2 teams of 4 to play this fun and tricky game. You can give hints, <br> but only have one chance to guess the word correctly. In other words, <br> this is definitely a game you’ll want to check out!</h3>

    <h2>4.Reverse Charades.</h2>
    <div class="img">
    <img src="Reverse-Charades-Fun-Family-Games.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <h3>Don’t like the spotlight on you, but love to play group games? This game is perfect because you act as <br> a group and one person is responsible for guessing the correct answer! First, <br> grab some paper slips. After that, have everyone write down a few things to act out. <br> You set the categories and determine how many points you need to win; however, you have a whole team by your side while you’ <br>re acting it out! If your teammate guesses correctly before the timer runs out, <br> you get a point! This is one where you’ll want to have the camera ready.
    </h3>

    <h2>5. Psychiatrist.</h2>
    <div class="img">
    <img src="Psychiatrist-Fun-Family-Games-600x400.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <h3>This is one of the most fun games to play with a group. First, have one person <br> (the doctor) leave the room. After that, everyone left picks an “illness.” Finally, <br> the doctor returns and has to figure out what the illness is by just asking questions!
